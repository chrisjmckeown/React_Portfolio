          Out of University I worked for a successful residential New Zealand
          architectural firm. I started using AutoCAD Architecture 3.3, and
          extended his talent for computer programming by completing a Bachelor
          of Information Technology in 2003.

          I continued to develop his 3D modelling skills, using AutoCAD
          Architecture 2011 as the BIM Manager in a large London Healthcare
          Practice. I moved to Australia in early 2011 to implement Revit as BIM
          Manager at Melbourne-based commercial design practice METIER3.

          Throughout my career, I have always searched for the most effective
          and efficient procedures to complete any given task. My current
          knowledge of architectural practice ensures that I am well aware of
          the existing gaps in workflows to produce quality documentation.
